# Environment Setup

## 1 - Prepare your Microsoft 365 tenant

**Need a development environment?**

If you don't currently have an Microsoft 365 work/school account, you can sign up for a **[Microsoft 365 Developer Program](https://aka.ms/m365developers)** subscription. It's free for 90 days and will continually renew as long as you're using it for development activity. If you have a Visual Studio Enterprise or Professional subscription, both programs include a free Microsoft 365 developer subscription, active for the life of your Visual Studio subscription. See Set up a Microsoft 365 developer subscription.

**Already have a Microsoft 365 account?**

If you are a Microsoft 365 subscriber, you can develop apps with Microsoft Graph by using one of the following [plans](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ww/microsoft-365/enterprise/compare-office-365-plans?rtc=1):

* Business Essentials
* Business Premium
* Enterprise E1, E3, and E5
* Developer
* Education, Education Plus, and Education E5
* Microsoft Teams will also be available to customers who subscribed to E4 prior to its retirement.

## 2 - Install Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code (Recommended)

The Teams Toolkit is an extension for Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio 2022 that helps developers create and deploy Microsoft Teams apps with integrated identity, cloud storage, and other services across Microsoft 365 and Azure.
